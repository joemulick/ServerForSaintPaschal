	bio: 'Saint Christopher, (flourished 3rd century; Western feast day July 25; Eastern feast day May 9), patron saint of travelers and, in the 20th century, of motorists, one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. Though one of the most popular saints, there is no certainty that he existed historically. According to the Roman martyrology, he died in Lycia under the Roman emperor Decius (c. 250). He is the hero of many later legends, which represent him as a giant who, after being converted, devoted his life to carrying travelers across a river.'
